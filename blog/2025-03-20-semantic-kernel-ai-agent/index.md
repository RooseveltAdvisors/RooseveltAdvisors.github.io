# Architecting Enterprise AI Research Agents with Semantic Kernel

In this post, I'll share my experience and insights from architecting an enterprise-ready AI research agent using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework. This project involved porting an open-source AI research solution into a secure, scalable architecture suitable for enterprise deployment.

## Background

GPTResearcher is a powerful open-source tool that leverages large language models to conduct comprehensive research on any topic. While impressive in capability, the original implementation lacked the enterprise-grade features necessary for corporate environments, including:

- Integration with enterprise identity systems
- Secure API management
- Real-time communication mechanisms
- Scalable architecture
- Deployment flexibility

## The Semantic Kernel Approach

Microsoft's Semantic Kernel provided an ideal foundation for transforming this research agent into an enterprise solution. Semantic Kernel offers:

- A lightweight, extensible framework for AI orchestration
- Modular architecture with plugins
- Memory and context management
- Strong .NET integration

## Architecture Overview

The enterprise solution architecture includes several key components:

1. **Core Research Engine**: Ported to Semantic Kernel plugins and skills
2. **Authentication Layer**: Azure AD integration with custom token validation
3. **API Management**: Azure APIM for rate limiting and security
4. **Communication Layer**: WebSocket and SSE implementation for real-time updates
5. **Deployment Framework**: Containerized for flexibility across environments

## Implementation Highlights

### Semantic Kernel Plugin Architecture

The research workflow was decomposed into Semantic Kernel plugins, each handling specific aspects of the research process:

```csharp
public class ResearchPlugin
{
    [SKFunction]
    public async Task<string> GenerateResearchPlan(string topic)
    {
        // Implementation
    }

    [SKFunction]
    public async Task<string> ExecuteSearch(string query)
    {
        // Implementation
    }

    [SKFunction]
    public async Task<string> AnalyzeContent(string content)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Real-time Progress Updates

One of the challenges was providing real-time progress updates during lengthy research operations:

```csharp
public class ResearchStreamingService
{
    private readonly ISubject<ResearchUpdate> _updates = new Subject<ResearchUpdate>();
    
    public IObservable<ResearchUpdate> Updates => _updates.AsObservable();
    
    public void PublishUpdate(ResearchUpdate update)
    {
        _updates.OnNext(update);
    }
}
```

### Azure AD Authentication

Custom authentication middleware was implemented to validate Azure AD tokens and enforce role-based access:

```csharp
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapHub<ResearchHub>("/research-hub").RequireAuthorization(policy => 
{
    policy.RequireAuthenticatedUser();
    policy.RequireRole("ResearchUser");
});
```

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, several key insights emerged:

1. **Plugin Granularity**: Finding the right balance of plugin granularity is crucial for maintaining flexibility without creating excessive complexity.

2. **Memory Management**: LLM context management requires careful design, especially when handling large research documents.

3. **Authentication Flow**: Enterprise authentication adds complexity that must be handled throughout the application.

4. **Streaming Responses**: Real-time research updates require thoughtful architecture patterns that work across different deployment models.

5. **API Management Integration**: Properly integrating with APIM involves more than simple routing - it requires thoughtful design of rate limiting, caching, and security policies.

## Conclusion

Semantic Kernel provided an excellent foundation for transforming a standalone AI research tool into an enterprise-grade solution. The modular architecture, combined with Azure's identity and API management capabilities, created a secure, scalable solution for AI-powered research in corporate environments.

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into specific aspects of this architecture and share code examples for implementing enterprise patterns with Semantic Kernel.
