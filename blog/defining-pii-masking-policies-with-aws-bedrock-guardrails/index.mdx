## **Introduction**

## **What is Amazon Bedrock Guardrails?**

- Amazon Bedrock Guardrails are a robust feature within the Amazon Bedrock service designed to enhance the safety, compliance, and overall quality of interactions with AI models. Guardrails provide a comprehensive set of tools that allow organizations to define and enforce content policies, ensuring that the AI models deployed adhere to specific guidelines and avoid generating inappropriate, sensitive, or off-topic content.

**Guardrails support multiple layers of content moderation, including:**

1. **Content Filtering:** Automatically classify and filter out harmful or inappropriate content based on predefined categories such as hate speech, violence, and sexual content. This ensures that the AI models do not engage in or propagate harmful interactions.
2. **Denied Topics:** Define specific topics that should be blocked in user inputs and model responses. This feature allows for the prohibition of discussions around sensitive or restricted subjects, enhancing compliance with organizational policies.
3. **Word Filters:** Implement specific word filters to block or mask certain words or phrases in both user inputs and model responses. This includes the ability to enable pre-defined profanity lists or custom lists tailored to organizational needs.
4. **Sensitive Information Filters:** Redact or mask personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data using predefined types or custom regular expressions (RegEx). This feature helps in protecting user privacy and complying with data protection regulations.
5. **Custom Messaging:** Define custom messages for blocked prompts and responses, providing clear and consistent feedback to users when content is filtered or denied. This ensures transparency and helps maintain a positive user experience.
6. **Testing and Tracing:** Test guardrails in real-time with built-in tools that allow for the evaluation of user prompts and model responses. The trace feature provides detailed insights into which guardrails were triggered and the actions taken, enabling continuous improvement and fine-tuning.
