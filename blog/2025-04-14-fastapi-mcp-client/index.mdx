I've been working on a project to support SSE for MCP. Couldn't find any good example on the client in Python for supporting SSE with FastAPI MCP. So I wrote it up myself and thought I will share everyone. Hope everyone find it useful.

# What is the Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard for communication between
applications and AI models or services. It provides a structured way to:

1. **Establish a session** between client and server
2. **Call model-powered tools** with parameters
3. **Process streaming results** in a standardized format
4. **Maintain context** across multiple interactions

This protocol is particularly valuable for applications that need to interact with AI services while
supporting streaming responses - a pattern that's becoming increasingly common as models
generate content incrementally.

# The MCP Flow: How It Works

MCP over Server-Sent Events (SSE) creates a robust pattern for streaming AI responses:

```javascript
┌────────┐                                   ┌────────┐
│        │  1. GET /mcp (SSE connection)     │        │
│        │ ─────────────────────────────────►│        │
│        │                                   │        │
│        │  2. SSE: session_id=XXX           │        │
│        │ ◄─────────────────────────────────│        │
│        │                                   │        │
│        │  3. POST /mcp/messages/?session_id│        │
│ Client │    {method: "initialize"}         │ Server │
│        │ ─────────────────────────────────►│        │
│        │                                   │        │
│        │  4. POST /mcp/messages/?session_id│        │
│        │    {method: "tools/call", ...}    │        │
│        │ ─────────────────────────────────►│        │
│        │                                   │        │
│        │  5. SSE: streamed results         │        │
│        │ ◄─────────────────────────────────│        │
└────────┘                                   └────────┘
```

This pattern allows for efficient, one-way streaming from server to client with a persistent
connection, ideal for AI-generated content.

# The Gap in the Python Ecosystem

While FastAPI supports SSE and the MCP server implementation exists, there was a significant
gap:

* No dedicated Python client libraries for MCP over SSE
* Challenges in maintaining session state across requests
* Lack of examples showing proper error handling for stream interruptions
* No standardized approach for processing the streamed events

These gaps meant developers had to implement complex, error-prone boilerplate code to
interact with MCP servers.

# Introducing fastapi-mcp-client

The fastapi-mcp-client library solves these problems with a clean, async-first API that
handles all the complexities of the MCP protocol:

```python
import asyncio
from fastapi_mcp_client import MCPClient

async def main():
    async with MCPClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
        # Standard call - simple and clean
        result = await client.call_operation("echo", {"message": "Hello, MCP!"})
        print(f"Echo result: {result}")

        # Streaming call - same simple interface
        stream = await client.call_operation(
            "generate_numbers",
            {"count": 5},
            stream=True
        )

        async for event in stream:
            print(f"Event: {event}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

The library takes care of:

* Establishing and maintaining the SSE connection
* Session management
* Protocol message formatting
* Error handling
* Processing streaming responses

# Real-World Use Cases

This client excels in several scenarios:

1. **AI-Powered Chat Applications**: Stream token-by-token responses directly to users
2. **Document Search Systems**: Display search results as they're discovered
3. **Content Generation**: Show incremental progress for long-running generation tasks
4. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Stream processed chunks rather than waiting for full completion

# Getting Started

Installation is straightforward with either pip or uv:

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install fastapi-mcp-client

# Or with UV
uv add fastapi-mcp-client
```

The repository includes example servers and clients to help you get started quickly.
