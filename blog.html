A parent brings in a child with an ear infection. The exam is ambiguous — it could be viral, could be bacterial. You know antibiotics probably won't help, but the parent is expecting a prescription. You have 30 seconds to make a decision before the next patient. So you prescribe. This pattern, multiplied across thousands of encounters daily, is why 46% of urgent care antibiotics are medically unnecessary — and why antibiotic resistance is one of the CDC's top public health threats.","datePublished":"2026-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jon Roosevelt","description":"Consultant","url":"https://jonroosevelt.com","image":"https://github.com/RooseveltAdvisors.png"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https://jonroosevelt.com/img/blog/2026-01-24-delayed-prescription-antibiotic-stewardship-urgent-care/hero-banner.jpg","url":"https://jonroosevelt.com/img/blog/2026-01-24-delayed-prescription-antibiotic-stewardship-urgent-care/hero-banner.jpg","contentUrl":"https://jonroosevelt.com/img/blog/2026-01-24-delayed-prescription-antibiotic-stewardship-urgent-care/hero-banner.jpg","caption":"title image for the blog post: The Delayed Prescription Strategy: How to Reduce Antibiotic Use 62% While Maintaining Patient Satisfaction"},"keywords":[]},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@id":"https://jonroosevelt.com/blog/hybrid-scheduling-urgent-care","mainEntityOfPage":"https://jonroosevelt.com/blog/hybrid-scheduling-urgent-care","url":"https://jonroosevelt.com/blog/hybrid-scheduling-urgent-care","headline":"Why Urgent Care Centers Are Ditching Walk-In-Only: The Hybrid Scheduling Revolution","name":"Why Urgent Care Centers Are Ditching Walk-In-Only: The Hybrid Scheduling Revolution","description":"The urgent care industry is undergoing a quiet revolution in how patients are seen.

But Jordan Peterson argues we&#x27;re asking the wrong question. The better question isn&#x27;t &quot;what makes you happy?&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;what burden are you willing to carry?&quot; This reframing — from happiness-seeking to responsibility-accepting — might be the most important psychological insight of our generation.</p>

Providers spend more time documenting visits than examining patients. Front desk staff juggle phone calls, check-ins, and insurance verification while patients pile up in the waiting room. Administrative burden competes with clinical care for every minute of the workday. But two AI technologies are fundamentally changing this calculus in 2026: ambient AI scribes and AI front desk automation. These aren&#x27;t theoretical innovations — they&#x27;re deployed systems delivering measurable operational improvements today.</p>

Not as a simplification—literally. While competitors build orchestration frameworks with task queues, agent hierarchies, and complex state machines, Anthropic shipped a CLI that writes 90% of its own code using the simplest possible control flow.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t dumbing down the problem. It&#x27;s a philosophical stance on what AI agent architecture should be: trust the model, don&#x27;t over-engineer around limitations, and recognize that simplicity scales better than complexity.</p>

are your hours?&quot; &quot;Do you take my insurance?&quot; &quot;How long is the wait right now?&quot; These repetitive inquiries consume staff time that could be spent on clinical care. We built an AI-powered patient chatbot to handle these interactions automatically — and instrumented it with full observability so we can monitor quality in production.</p>

A parent brings in a child with an ear infection. The exam is ambiguous — it could be viral, could be bacterial. You know antibiotics probably won&#x27;t help, but the parent is expecting a prescription. You have 30 seconds to make a decision before the next patient. So you prescribe. This pattern, multiplied across thousands of encounters daily, is why 46% of urgent care antibiotics are medically unnecessary — and why antibiotic resistance is one of the CDC&#x27;s top public health threats.</p>

<p>This isn&#x27;t a proof-of-concept running on a laptop. It&#x27;s a production system processing thousands of documents with sub-3-second query latency, deployed on AWS infrastructure, and serving real business needs.</p>

Why would ancient cultures preserve such a psychologically brutal narrative? Dr. Jordan Peterson&#x27;s Genesis lecture series offers a compelling answer: this isn&#x27;t just a story about religious obedience. It&#x27;s a sophisticated psychological framework for understanding how human beings navigate time, create meaning, and build civilization itself.</p>
