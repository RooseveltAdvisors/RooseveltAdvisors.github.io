## Background

In my role as a Subject Matter Expert at NBCUniversal, I led the development of automated solutions for CCPA/GDPR compliance, utilizing Airflow and Databricks to streamline the "Data Subject Request" process for data deletion and masking. I tackled performance challenges in Adobe's real-time streaming processing, implementing a framework to optimize task distribution and enhance efficiency in Spark. 

Additionally, I developed real-time dashboards for subscription tracking and viewership monitoring, using tools like Looker to provide stakeholders with up-to-the-minute insights across platforms and events, from live broadcasts to major occasions like the 2024 elections and Black Friday.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Compliance Automation

- Developed Databricks notebooks for efficient data masking and deletion
- Created comprehensive audit trails for compliance verification
- Reduced manual processing time by over 85%

### Real-time Processing Optimization

- Identified bottlenecks in Adobe's streaming data pipeline
- Implemented custom Spark optimizations for enhanced throughput
- Designed framework for optimal task distribution across clusters
