## Technical Implementation

The front end is developed with React, while the server backend uses NodeJS and Express. The API services use a privately hosted Mistral-70B model fine-tuned on proprietary C-CDA datasets to handle tasks such as:

- Transcribing doctor-patient conversations
- Summarizing conversations into clinical notes
- Creating appropriate billing codes
- Providing medical information on demand
