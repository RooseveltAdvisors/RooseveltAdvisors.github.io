## FOAK Innovation Process

IBM's FOAK program follows a structured approach to innovation:

1. **Discovery Phase**: 
   - Identifying client needs and potential research applications
   - Developing initial concepts and assessing technical feasibility
   - Building relationships with industry partners

2. **Development Phase**:
   - Creating working prototypes of research concepts
   - Testing solutions with controlled client deployments
   - Iteratively refining based on feedback and performance

3. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Transitioning successful prototypes to product development
   - Documenting learnings and best practices
   - Establishing pathways for commercialization

This structured approach enables IBM Research to consistently deliver innovations that transform theoretical concepts into practical business solutions.
